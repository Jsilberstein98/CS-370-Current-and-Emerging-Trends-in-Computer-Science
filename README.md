This is the repository for CS-370,  Current and emerging trends in computer science.

In the attatched project, the code for everything except the Q-learning implementation was completed. This includes two Py classes that house the environment and episodes for game experience of the project. The code that I worked through was the Q-learning seciton where the program was able to learn and ultimately win on its own. This project showed me that it is beneficial to reread material and iterate upon what I have already worked through. Initially, the program I made did not allow for learning, and as such made the program only go in a straight line. This made the data I was recieving rather skewed, as I expected progress in iterations, only to get wins based on randomized chance. The newer version utilizes the exploitation exploration choices pretty well, and overall is well functioning.
